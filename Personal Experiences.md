#Personal Experiences
We are team QuiqSafe. Name of the members in this team are Raikhik, Siddharth, Sashank and Ravi. We personally did not know each other before participating in this challenge
as we study in different places of India. But working in this team was fun. We shared hours together working on the problem and we whole heartedly enjoyed that.
